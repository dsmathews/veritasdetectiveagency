                What is a background or a pre-employment check?
          </p>
                <p>
                Your future employees are, more than likely, going to be handling a massive amount of confidential and intimate data about you, your company, other employees, or any number of other classified sources of information. Additionally, as your employees, they are going to be the livelihood of your company. As much as you may want to believe that their resume and interview answers were honest and trustworthy, you can’t always be sure that they are telling the truth. That is why background, or pre-employment checks, are sometimes necessary.
                </p>
                <p>
                Let’s look at a scenario. You, the employer, are looking to hire Jim for a job at a bank that you are the manager of. From his resume, Jim seems to be a stellar worker. He has had a lot of experience and he does a lot of volunteer work in his community in his free time. Obviously, he is a dedicated worker and cares about other people. In the interview, your thoughts of Jim are confirmed and you hire him on the spot. However, within only a few weeks, you discover that Jim has been illegally siphoning money off of an account that he has been working with. Your company loses a lot of money from the account and also in having to deal with the legal troubles after the illegal dealings are found out. Jim lost your company tons of money.
            </p>
            <p>
                How can you prevent this from happening?
            </p>
            <p>
                You can prevent this from happening with background and pre-employment checks. Background and pre-employment checks are investigations into different aspects of potential employees. You can have their history investigated. You can have their past work experience investigated. In some countries, you can have their assets investigated. Whatever the specifics of the investigation are, the background and pre-employment check is conducted with the intent of learning valuable information about somebody before you actually hire them.
            </p>
            <p> 
                What are some things you could learn? You could learn about the criminal past of a potential employee. If a background check had been conducted on Jim in the scenario, you, the employer, could have learned that Jim had a criminal history in financial or checking fraud and known that he as prone to cause your business financial trouble. You could learn that the potential employee did not have good relations with their past employers, preventing any unneeded squabbles or problems in the workplace as well as assuring you a better, more hardworking employee. You could learn that your potential employee was involved with drugs, robbery, or other forms of criminal activity and, thus, had the information to make an informed decision over whether or not the potential employee was to be trusts.
            </p>
            <p>
                Knowledge if power, and a background and pre-employment check is what can give you the proper knowledge.
