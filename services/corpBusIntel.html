                How does private investigation connect to the business world?
        </h5>
        <p>
                The business world can be a messy, competitive place. As you are attempting to get ahead of competitors, competitors are trying to get ahead of you. In the business world, a little bit of information can go a long way—and that’s where private investigation matters.
            </p>
            <p>    
                Utilizing private investigative services in the business realm is a method of furthering business prospects and success through information.
            </p>
            <p> 
                For many people, business surveillance refers to the surveillance of employees. You, as the manager or one of a group of managers, want to ensure that your employees are staying on task, getting work done, and performing to the best of their ability without distractions or unneeded interruptions. Surveillance of employees is the easiest way to make this dream a reality, and, for many companies, surveillance of employees has become the number one concern.
            </p>
            <p> 
                Business surveillance can also, of course, refer to cameras and security measures. Businesses want to be able to protect their assets—whether those assets are physical property or the information contained within files stored at business sites, it does not matter. Nowadays, when many people say surveillance, they are thinking about surveillance or security cameras. In fact, the most generally used answer to any question querying “What is business surveillance” will be a plethora of suggestions and explanation of security options.
            </p>
            <p> 
                Lastly, business surveillance can also refer to investigations involving the collection of information pertaining to business ownership, business assets, financial standing of a business, and investigations executed to gain many other sorts of other information on many other aspects of a particular business. Some private investigators or investigative firms will provide analytical services that will review information with you and your business partners and help formulate a plan that will allow you to further your company’s goals or get ahead of your competitors. Of course, it is not necessary to involve private investigative services once you have your information. What you do with the information gained is completely up to you.
            </p>
            <p>  
                Business surveillance can refer to any number of things. It can be surveillance of employees, surveillance of physical premise, surveillance of information, competitors, finances—almost anything that you need information on! It is the third type of surveillance that a private investigator or a private investigative firm will be most able to help you on. Surveillance of employees and the physical premise are often easily managed by yourself, but broader, more expansive investigations often require the help of a professional. This is where an investigative service like Veritas Detective Agency will be able to help you.

            <h3 id="A1" class="text-center">Employee Fraud</h3>
            <p>
                Employee fraud can be devastating to a company. Unfortunately, it is during economic troubles, when your company and you will suffering from the most stress, that employee fraud is most likely to occur. It is important to be able to recognize the “red flags” of employees who are most likely to be committing employee fraud. Make sure to watch certain employees carefully, especially ones that consistently work late for no apparent reason, never take holidays, show unusual and sudden rises in wealth, have unusually close relationships with suppliers, or employees that cause consistent complaints from clients that may, along with you, be the victim of a fraud scheme. As a rule of thumb, make sure to be wary of employees that seem intent of working by themselves or are secretive, quiet, and do not disclose their work information easily. This is the best way to recognize somebody who may be operating their own illegal fraud empire within the confines of your reputable business.
            </p>
            <p> 
                There are many different types of employee fraud, and it is important to be familiar with each one so as to be able to recognize it and fix it.
            </p>
            <p>  
                One of the most common types of employee fraud is fraud of financial statements. Employees working with a company’s finances or in another position of high authority where financial statements and dealings are open and available to them must be watched. Financial statement fraud occurs when an employee forges financial information, creating fake assets, inflating assets, hiding accounts, hiding money, expenses, or any number of fraudulent financial dealings that require them to hide information from you, the employer.
            </p>
            <p>  
                Another very common type of fraud that runs rampant through all levels of a company is asset misappropriation, otherwise known as using company property inappropriately. Oftentimes, asset misappropriation seems innocent; an employee decides to use the company car for a non-work related excursion or borrows company technology for their own personal use. Other times, it is much more serious and can involve an employee misappropriating—or misusing or taking—company assets like money and checks. The consequences of asset misappropriation are dependent on the severity of the fraud.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another, very common, type of fraud is often vaguely coined “corruption”. Corruption, or the acceptance of bribes and kickbacks, is a type of employee fraud that, like financial statement fraud, is found in the upper levels of a company where employees have more power. When an employee accepts bribes, that is considered corruption. When an employee gives special discounts or free services to somebody in exchange for gifts or kickbacks, that is considered corruption. In an employee offers any sort of unauthorized, special service to a customer or client in exchange for goods or services for themselves (at the cost of the company) then they are engaging in a type of employee fraud called corruption.
            </p>
            <p>
                Of course, there are many other types of employee fraud. These are only the most common three main types. If you, as an employer, feel as though your employees may be engaging in any of the aforementioned fraudulent behavior then it is your right to seek out investigative services in order to facilitate an investigation to gain information.
