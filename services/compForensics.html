        <p>
            Computer forensics (or computer forensic science) is unique in that it refers to both data recovery and the investigation of criminal activity. While data recovery is rather simple in that it only involves the recovery of data that was lost to an individual or business, the investigation of criminal activity is much more complex in that it involves laws, legal systems, and the finding of evidence that can be produced in court.
        </p>
        <p>
            The investigation of computer crimes is actually very similar in practice to the recovery of computer data; both involve trying to find something that now seems lost in the technologic world. In computer data recovery, the information was accidentally lost. However, in the investigation of computer crimes, the information was purposefully hidden or deleted.
          </p>
          <p> 
            It is important to realize the validity (and subsequent importance) of information that is gathered through computer forensics. Almost all courts around the world accept computer forensics evidence information as valid evidence along with almost all other types of digital information.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is also important to realize one other thing: those who work in computer forensics are more than IT specialists. They are also investigators.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are a few common techniques employed by computer forensic specialists to try and uncover hidden or deleted data. These include cross-drive analysis, live analysis, deleted files, and stenography. Cross-drive analysis is a method that is still being researched and practiced, but the other three techniques are rather widespread. Live analysis is most often employed when encountering encrypted file systems and involves the live extraction of information before computer shutdown. Techniques involving deleted files are probably the easiest technique and also the most similar to simple data recovery. When file are deleted, computers retain information somewhere within the hard drive; it is the job of the investigator to extract it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Stenography is unique. Stenography actually refers to the criminal practice of hiding information within pictures or media files. Therefore, stenography is not a technique employed by computer forensics specialists. Rather, they employ techniques to combat it. They must find information stored within pictures or digital images, recover them, and clean them up for presentation as evidence.
          </p>
            <p>
            Whatever the technique a computer forensic specialist chooses to employ to gain covered up or destroyed material, they must make sure to work with the greatest possible speed, recognizing the volatile nature of the information they are working with. A computer shutdown may mean the complete destruction of information. Often, when a computer reboots, no trace of certain types of material will ever be able to be found again. This was mentioned before in live analysis, but it is also incredibly important for deleted file recovery as many of the temporary files the forensic specialists use are emptied when computers reboot.
          </p>
