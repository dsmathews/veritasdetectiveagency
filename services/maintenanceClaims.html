                <p>
                    What are maintenance claims? That is a very important question to be asking before anything else.
                    After all, you need to know what something is before you know why you would ever need investigative
                    services to be involved in it.</p>

                <p>Maintenance claims are claims that are made about care, sustainment, or upkeep. In most cases,
                    maintenance claims have to do with a property or certain elements of a property that is rented out
                    or on contract to be cared for by a company of individual. When said property or certain elements
                    are not cared for as per a contract or agreement, a maintenance claim is filed.</p>

                <p>
                    In some cases, maintenance claims are also involved with post divorce cases. During divorce
                    proceedings, maintenance agreements will be reached whereby one spouse may agree to provide a
                    certain amount of money or pay for certain things for another spouse or for a child that will be in
                    the custody of said spouse. When these maintenance stipulations are not fulfilled by one of the
                    spouses, a maintenance claim can be filed to try and regain lost maintenance money and to ensure
                    that maintenance fees will continue to be paid.</p>

                <p>Veritas Detective Agency is one such investigative company that will be able to provide you with
                    professional help gathering evidence required for maintenance claims. Our professional private
                    investigators will be able to help you seek out evidence and proof of maintenance problems,
                    document, and submit it. They will also be able to investigate any individuals who are not following
                    through on maintenance contracts. Much like with other investigation cases, private investigators
                    that work for the Veritas Detective Agency will be able to engage in a full scale tracking
                    investigation into any guilty individuals to learn where money from the contract is being used and
                    where they are shirking off their maintenance duties. Substantial proof, eye witness accounts, and
                    the involvement of a third party professional service are all great ways to get your maintenance
                    claim noticed and get the legal proceedings surrounding your maintenance claim moving.</p>

                    <p>
                        After saving up money, Angie decides to move into a condo complex at the edge of town. She buys
                        her condo, but, as part of the agreement of living in the complex, she pays a certain amount of
                        money every month that goes towards paying for upkeep of community grounds like the hallways,
                        elevators, pool, and gardens. Angie lives in the condo for one year and pays her dues every
                        month. At the end of the first year, she notices that the elevator nearest her condo is no
                        longer working. She calls the building manager, tells him about the elevator, and he promises to
                        send out a repairman to fix the elevator by the end of the week. A week passes. A month passes.
                        Eventually, Angie and the other families that live in the condo form a group to file a
                        maintenance claim because they have been paying their monthly maintenance dues but the building
                        manager has not been providing them with maintenance.</p>
                    <p>
                        The maintenance claim gets taken to court. There are lengthy legal proceedings and lots of money
                        and time is spent. Yet, the elevator is still not fixed. Angie and the other families living in
                        the condo complex are all very frustrated, annoyed, and sad. They are continuing to have to pay
                        their maintenance dues, but nobody is performing maintenance on their condo!</p>

                    <p>What should Angie and everybody else do?</p>
                    <p>
                        The best thing for them to do in this situation is seek professional investigative help. In
                        today’s day and age, maintenance claims have become a common legal proceeding. However, though
                        they are common, that doesn’t mean that they are easily settled or easily handled. Sometimes,
                        all of the pushing, prodding, complaints, and demands in the world are not enough to make the
                        legal proceedings of a maintenance claim move any faster. Many times, they are viewed as too
                        commonplace or simply to lowly to be taken notice of. Angie and all of the families in the
                        complex need some professional help to document and investigate the lack of maintenance of their
                        complex.</p>
